    <img src="lasagna-image.jpg" alt="Cooked lasagna">

    <p>A rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly 
    fresh onions and garlic, lathered in a succulent sauce and topped with imported, 
    premium quality mozzarella.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
        <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
        <li>a little grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g pack fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>white sauce</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>
            <p>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 
            750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all 
            over.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the 
            meat mixture.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot 
            beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 
            30 x 20cm).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh 
            lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade 
            white sauce.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white
            sauce, making sure you can't see any pasta poking through.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top 
            is bubbling and lightly browned.</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
