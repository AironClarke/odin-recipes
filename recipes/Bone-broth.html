    <h1>Bone broth</h1>

    <img src="bone_broth.jpg" alt="Bone Broth">

    <p>For good flavour and nutrition, a beef marrow bone is a great addition to this bone 
    broth. Make up the rest with chicken carcasses from roasts or lamb bones, which are 
    also good for a rich flavour. Dont forget the vinegar, the acid helps to extract 
    the minerals and collagen from the bones.<p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2kg/4lb 8oz mixed bones, such as beef, lamb or chicken carcasses</li>
        <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
        <li>3 carrots, quartered</li>
        <li>1 garlic bulb, halved horizontally</li>
        <li>2 celery sticks, cut into 5cm/2in lengths</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 tsp black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and line a baking tray with 
            baking paper.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Put the bones on the tray and roast for 30 minutes. Turn the bones, 
            add the onion, carrot and garlic and roast for another 10 &#8208 15 minutes, 
            or until the bones are very browned and the vegetables are just browned.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Transfer the bones mixture to a very large pot or saucepan with a lid. 
            Add the celery, bay leaves and peppercorns and cover with cold water &#8208 it 
            should come about 5cm/2in above the contents of the pan. Drizzle in the 
            vinegar.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Cover with a lid and bring to the boil, then turn the heat to a very low 
            simmer. Cook, occasionally skimming off and discarding any foam and fat, for 
            8 &#8208 12 hours. It tastes better the longer it simmers, but just check the 
            water levels occasionally and top up if the bones are uncovered. If the 
            majority of the bones are beef, chill the broth overnight in the fridge then 
            continue cooking the next day for up to 24 hours in total. You can also make 
            bone broth in a slow cooker on High for the same cooking time.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Strain the broth through a fine sieve, discarding the bones and vegetables, 
            then leave to cool before chilling. The broth will last 5 days in the fridge 
            and up to 6 months in the freezer.
